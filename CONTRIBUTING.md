# How to contribute

If you're reading this, you're awesome, because we really need volunteers to help this project come to fruition.  

Please discuss changes and features via issue or with one of the other developers.  

## Testing

We have a set of Mocha and Chai tests, so please try to run then before and after your changes to check their impact.  

## Submitting changes

Please send a Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).  

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:  

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

  * We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)  
  * We always use double quotes (" ") for strings  
  * We end lines with semicolons (;)  
  * We put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`) and around operators (`x += 1`)  
  * Consider the people who will read your code, think of the children, and keep the code nice.  

You can automate this with our pre-configured ESLint set of rules.  
Okay, perhaps the last part can't be automated, but it's very useful.

You shall have our eternal gratitude for helping out.
