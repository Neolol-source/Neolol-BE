# Change Log  
Neolol is a new meme site, where you laugh at funny stuff. The project is managed by a small team with the hope of keeping together a dedicated community.     
  
## [0.1.0] - 2020-05-27  
  This is our first minor version since the project started!

The team worked hard to make a site with basic functionality that looks and feels good.  
   
### Added  
We have a whole slew of features to kick off:  
- Users:  
  - People can sign-up with email, after completing a captcha. The accounts have unique usernames and nicknames.  
  - After registering, they become full fledged users with their own profiles. The profiles have dedicated pages, where users can see their posts and comments, along with a customizable description.  
      - Also from the profile page, users can change their description and nickname.  
  - They can also view other users' profiles.  
- Posts:  
  - Users can upload posts, in any format, along with a title.  
  - Users can see other users' posts, sorted by popularity, just the way we're used: Front, Rising and Fresh.  
      - If they choose to, they can see comments for the posts in this view mode.  
  - Users can open a page with just a post, and view a lot more comments there.  
  - Users can leave comments as well on the posts  
  - Users can vote on posts and comments, and increase their score  
  - Users can toggle mature content on their profile settings  
  - The first pancake always sucks: users can delete their posts and comments  
      - if they didn't make that big of a blunder, user can edit the post title and the comment text  
      
### Changed
